            <p class="paragraphInline">, better known by its TV series adaptation,

            <p class="paragraphInline">, by George R. R. Martin to the 
            <p class="bold">Lord of the Rings (LOTR) 
            <p class="paragraphInline"> trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien. I chose these series as they
                are both some of the most iconic and well read books within the fantasy fiction
                genre. Both series have produced extremely lucrative film/TV adaptations. The LOTR
                trilogy was published between 1954 and 1955, and the first book in ASOIAF was
                released in 1996, and it's most recent (5th) book was release in 2011; the series is
                still being written today. LOTR has a word count of 481,103 words and ASOIAF
                currently has more than 1.7 million words.</p>

            <!--            3-gram comparison paragraph-->
            <p class="paragraph"> Despite ASOIAF's massive word count advantage, the freqeuency of
                the top 15 3-grams is fairly comparable between the two series. LOTR seems to be 1/2
                to 1/3 of the frequency of the ASIOAF 3-grams at the same rank.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> The top ASOIAF 3-grams seem to be more specific to the series than
                the LOTR grams. For example, GOT has grams like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>king s landing </li>
                <li>the king s </li>
                <li>the night s </li>
                <li>the seven kingdoms</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph"> Whereas the only real series specific 3-gram for LOTR is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>in the shire</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">They share 3 grams in common:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>he did not</li>
                <li>i don t</li>

            <!--            3-gram comparison paragraph-->
            <p class="paragraph"> By the nature and commonality of the phrases, it is unsurprising
                that all 3 grams have similar following words. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> While "I don't" and "I do not" are synonymous, it looks like they
                are not actually used synonymously when written (or "spoken"). For both texts, "I do
                not" is consistently followed by "know." However, in ASOIAF, "I don't" is more
                commonly followed by "want" whereas it is still followed by "know" in LOTR.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> Contrarily, "he did not" is followed by "know in ASOIAF, but maybe
                be more commonly followed by "know" or "speak" in LOTR. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> Regarding what is (not) known by the characters of both books, the
                language paints the LOTR characters more of a pondering light, often contemplating
                within an inner monologue. In ASOIAF, most statements are spoken aloud, with an
                action-based implication.</p>

            <h2>Voyant Tools Analysis</h2>
            <!--            3-gram comparison paragraph-->
            <p class="paragraph"> Within Voyant Tools, many of the common words are names of the
                characters for both series. Tyrion, Jon, Arya, etc. vs Frodo, Gandalf, Pippin,
                etc.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> ASOIAF is further inundated by the many titles, such as ser, lord, queen. The use of
                names and titles appropriately suggests the abundance of characters within the
                series.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Many of the action-verbs are proactive "came, make, say, took." And several of the
                more miscellaneous have a darker and more violent nature, for example, "blood,
                sword, dead,"</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> On the other hand, many of the LOTR words are descriptive or imply observance. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> There are many positional words or adjectives "side, behind, left, far." The action
                verbs are more passive, "saw, looked, think"</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> There differences in the two texts aligns with Tolkien's descriptive style that
                paints the narrative and world to his readers. His characters are thinking and
                observing the world around them constantly. Martin's style is more plot driven, and
                is written by new events constantly occuring to keep his reader on edge.</p>
