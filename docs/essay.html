            <p class="paragraph"> I focused on developing the entirety of my GitHub website before
                working on the sites.psu.edu version. My learning process was based on trial and
                error and utilizing online resources like W3Schools. I had no specific vision in
                mind for my website but established a theme from experimentation. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> I found the formatting to be the most difficult aspect as a new
                learner. My CSS code would sometimes figuratively collide with another segment of
                code that was overwriting it, preventing the changes I wanted from occurring. I also
                found it difficult at times to decipher where to best place my formatting code, such
                as on the entire element verses creating a class or id for it specifically. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Sections and divs were elements that were challenging to understand
                for modifying the layout and organization of my site. It took a lot of
                experimentation to understand how to use them effectively and figure out how to
                layer design elements. I also made some id elements when in retrospect, I should
                have made them classes to be able to consistently reuse them. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> The primary skill needed for web development through GitHub is
                understanding how HTML and CSS code works and the various elements that are
                available for use. The more knowledge about HTML and CSS’ capabilities, the less
                limited the designer is in creating the exact vision they want. There is also a
                creative aspect in understanding design aspects to make a website clearly and easily
                readable and accessible. A designer should also be comfortable with testing and
                debugging their code consistently. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> As someone who still has a long way to go in website development,
                I would like to learn more of the capabilities of HTML and CSS. In particular, I
                would like to add more subtle animations that create a more seamless and
                professional look for my website. </p>
            <!--        Sites Essay section-->
            <h2>Sites.psu.edu</h2>
            <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/jvs7215/"> https://sites.psu.edu/jvs7215/ </a>
            <p class="paragraph"> Developing a website on sites.psu.edu was an overall easier
                experience for creating a site with an acceptable level of professionalism. However,
                if I wanted to capture the same design elements from my GitHub website, I would have
                a much harder time replicating them. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> As a new learner, the most significant challenge was navigating to
                where I needed to go to edit certain aspects of the website, such as the main
                website verses the pages, the nav bar, or the posts; which are all in different
                areas. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> It was challenging to under how to best format images on the site.
                The website offers some convenient presets (for size, placement etc.) but those
                presets can also become roadblocks. If I manually adjusted my image size, the
                quality seemed to become poorly affected, and it meant that I couldn’t replicate
                that exact size on a subsequent image. I also lacked full control in image placement
                and wasn’t sure how to place two images next to one another aesthetically. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> By nature, graphic design is an important skill on sites.psu.edu.
                However, to a lesser degree than with GitHub thanks to the predesigned layouts,
                formats, and themes available. It offers and encourages aspects to make websites
                more accessible and user friendly that should be utilized by the designer. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> I felt that I barely scratched the surface of website design with
                sites.psu.edu and I feel like there is much more to uncover that could improve my
                website, such as exploring the offered themes and adapting them to my own website
                appropriately and uniquely. </p>
            <!--        Conclusion-->
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="paragraph"> The advantages of using GitHub website development allowed me to
                see any changes I made nearly right away. On the other hand, sites.psu.edu allowed a
                pseudo real-time editing system, where you can see a simplified version of your
                edits, but it takes slightly longer to see them published on the real website. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> GitHub development offers many paths to solving or debugging
                issues, although sometimes that would mean there is no clear solution. I ran into
                far fewer problems on sites.psu.edu but I had a much harder time figuring out
                workarounds when I did. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> Sites.psu.edu’s primary advantage is that it is friendlier to
                beginners who have no experience in website development or understanding of
                HTML/CSS. It is simple and straightforward, but consequently limited. Its presets
                and themes allow beginners to create a professional website without much technical
                expertise or coding knowledge. Alternatively, GitHub offered and more curated and
                challenging experience, but a greater freedom in creating a unique website. </p>
