                </h2>
                <p> The world has changed. Human beings are forced to live inside mechanical titans
                    in symbiosis to survive. But their balance is still disturbed. The healer has to
                    venture out, find the titans who suffer from humanity and heal them. "Inner
                    Life" is a puzzle adventure game with alot of dialogue, taking place in a
                    dystopian setting. There are many different characters and you will have to
                    understand their stories and the healers story in order to aid the titan they
                    are living in.</p>

                    <p class="bold">Look and listen in the game: What features (or assets) are
                        helping to create an illusion of exploring a world? How simple or complex
                        are the graphics and media? </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> The world is brought to life by the use of sound design and lighting.
                            The initial level immerses the player by throwing them into a stressful
                            and dark environment with flashing red lights and blaring alarms. The
                            player character holds onto a lantern that illuminates their immediate
                            radius, leaving the surrounding map dim and obscured. The limitation of
                            visibility prompts the player to explore their surroundings
                            thoroughly.</li>
                        <li>The graphics are in a simplistic but charming pixel art style, with more
                            detailed character portraits and cutscene graphics. The camera is top
                            down and follows the player character. </li>

                        you explore and what makes the settings distinctive? </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The various “maps” and level designs of the game tend to be made up of
                            rooms and hallways. The rooms and hallways tend to be “blocky” and
                            comprised of straight edges. The player can only ever control the healer
                            when they are in some part of a titan. As a result, the rooms often have
                            metal or mechanical aspects. Circuitry, pipes, and moving mechanical
                            parts can be seen throughout the setting. </li>
                        <li>The outside world, while not accessible to the player, can be seen via
                            cutscenes. The outside is a desolate wasteland of sand and dust that is
                            uninhabitable to organic life. </li>

                    <p class="bold"> What kind(s) of character(s) are you invited to control? Are
                        you invited to be multiple characters? Or just one character type? </p>

                        <li>The player can only control the main character, the healer. </li>

                <li>
                    <p class="bold">How do you get to know the character(s) you are playing? What
                        details make them distinctive, quirky, memorable, etc?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The healer’s character is built through their thoughts/dialogue,
                            purpose, and design. The healer’s thoughts appear as part of the game’s
                            narrative and occasionally in a thought box that appears in the top
                            right corner of the screen while playing. Through the healer’s thoughts,
                            the player can understand the healer’s mission to save the titans. The
                            player can also choose between dialogue options, either an empathic or
                            aggressive, no-nonsense approach. Even when choosing the more abrasive
                            dialogue decision, the healer’s altruistic nature shrines through. </li>
                        <li>Taking on the burden of healing the titans puts them in dangerous
                            conditions, both short term and long term. There are constant
                            environmental hazards as the healer navigates the game. It is revealed
                            that the dust and sand from the ruined environment has affected their
                            health over time. The healer is sick and frequently coughs during the
                            game, but still persists, if only to prioritize the remaining titans. </li>
                        <li>The healer’s has a unique, non-human design, distinguishing them from
                            all the other characters besides Toni (the titan). They wear a hat and
                            cloak and carry a glowing purple lantern, and their face is bird-like
                            with red eyes. </li>

                    <p class="bold">What kinds of interactions do you have with NPC characters? </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The healer interacts most frequently with Toni the titan, who they are
                            trying to save. Within Toni, encounters various humans who live there.
                            The humans tend to be fairly one dimensional, if only because the healer
                            interacts with them for short durations. Toni has the most development
                            and depth, as well as screentime. The characters have no audible
                            dialogue but sound effects. </li>
                        <li>Typically, the humans that the healer encounters are in some sort of
                            predicament, and the healer must help them in order to continue fixing
                            Toni. </li>

                <li>
                    <p class="bold">How are you challenged as a game player in this game? What are
                        you being asked to investigate, where do you get stuck, and how do you make
                        progress in the game? </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As a player, the most frustrating aspect was running into multiple bugs.
                            In the first instance, the "spotlight” that surrounds the player
                            “broke-off” and moved separately from the character sprite, making
                            investigating the map very difficult. In another instance, I walked
                            through a door, and the room on the other side would not load no matter
                            how many times I tried. Because there is no way to save or load
                            checkpoints, I had to start the game from the very beginning. This was
                            particularly tedious because the character has one set, slow walking
                            speed. The text also scrolls slowly, without any way to skip or speed
                            through. I also ran into other rooms that would not load later in the
                            game but was able to get them to function after continuously going back
                            in and out. </li>
                        <li>Mechanically, the game is easy and has a simple control scheme. The
                            player can use “WASD” to move, "e" to interact or pickup an item, and
                            "q” to drop an item. </li>
                        <li>In terms of the intended gameplay, there are an abundance of fetch
                            quests that feel redundant over time. The actual puzzles are extremely
                            simple and don’t require any critical thinking. The environmental
                            hazards primarily required patience, but not skill, to pass through. </li>
                        <li>To progress the game, the healer usually needs to acquire an item or
                            solve a puzzle. </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The healer can pick up a variety of objects, from screwdrivers to fish,
                            whatever is most applicable depending on the situation. They can
                            interact with simple mechanics, such as switches. There are no written
                            messages, but interacting with an object may offer some insight from the
                            healer. There is no food or health system, if the healer dies to an
                            environmental hazard, they simply restart at the beginning of the

                        into the game, and is it effective, supportive of game play? Do the sounds
                        in the game provide clues of what is happening, or have a particular
                        function in the game?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ambiance of Inner Life is created by the sounds of the player’s
                            echoing footstep and their occasional coughing. Eerie, metallic clanging
                            expresses the emptiness and hollowness inside the titans they explore.
                            While the game does not usually have music playing, atmospheric sound
                            effects such as dripping water break up the monotony. Occasionally,
                            there is music in cutscenes to emphasize the emotional aspect. </li>
                        <li>The sounds vary depending on the player’s location, but are generally
                            consistent, and supportive of the gameplay and setting. The sounds imply
                            various world-building aspects but have no particular function besides
                            that. </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>While not a direct comment, there is an instance where the healer
                            encounters a human named Woody, who has a peg leg and is stuck inside a
                            machine. To get Woody out, the player saws of his last functional leg,

                            makes a big deal out of the situation, cementing the media as a work of
                            fiction that doesn’t take itself too seriously. </li>

                            that it is commenting on the direction the world is headed in relation
