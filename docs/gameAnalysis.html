                <li>Look and listen in the game: What features (or assets) are helping to create an
                    illusion of exploring a world? How simple or complex are the graphics and
                    media?</li>
                <li>How simple or complex are the settings in the game? How far can you explore and
                    what makes the settings distinctive? </li>
                <li>What kind(s) of character(s) are you invited to control? Are you invited to be
                    multiple characters? Or just one character type? </li>
                <li>How do you get to know the character(s) you are playing? What details make them
                    distinctive, quirky, memorable, etc? </li>
                <li>What kinds of interactions do you have with NPC characters? </li>
                <li>How are you challenged as a game player in this game? What are you being asked
                    to investigate, where do you get stuck, and how do you make progress in the
                    game? </li>
                <li> What kinds of objects do you interact with in the game? Do you pick up written
                    messages, do you ever need to consume food in the game, do you pick up
                    functional things you need to get other things work? </li>
                <li> Comment on sounds and music in your game. How are sounds built into the game,
                    and is it effective, supportive of game play? Do the sounds in the game provide
                    clues of what is happening, or have a particular function in the game? </li>
                <li> Where (if ever) do you see the game comment on itself in a meta way as a
                    fictional, constructed system (as a game)? </li>
                <li> Where and how do you see the game respond to or comment on our reality? Or what
                    cultural issues from our world do you see reflected in this game? </li>
